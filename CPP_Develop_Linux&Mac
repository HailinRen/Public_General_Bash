## For Linux
# I prefer open-source and free editor and use command line
# You can use IDE such as CLion, which is good for beginers, but that's not my style.
# Download and Install Atom or VS Code (Preferred) from website
# Install gcc and build-essential and gdb
# Install GNU compiler tools and the GDB debugger
sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb
# Check GCC (GNU Compiler Collection, mainly for C and C++)
gcc -v
